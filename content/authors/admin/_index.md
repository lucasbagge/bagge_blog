My name is Lucas Bagge and I am a data scientist and analysis at Blackwoodseven where I work on data management and buildings models. I am original from the small city Klovborg that is famouse for the
cheese with the same name. I love making beautiful charts with the statistical programming language R, seeing movies and being with my wife and daughter.

I studied economics and though econometrics I fell in love with machine learning. Therefore my
carrier took a different path then the usual one. So I have spend every hour of my days becomming the best data scientist though hard working at `Annalect`, `Ministery of Finance`, `Ã˜rsted` and `Blackwoodseven`. My key interest is NLP and neural network and how they can be applied in real analysis that can make a difference for the average human.
